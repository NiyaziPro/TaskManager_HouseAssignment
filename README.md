1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskmeister.git
cd taskmeister
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure email settings:**
   - Open `taskmeister.py`
   - Update the `Config` class with your SMTP settings:
   ```python
   class Config:
       SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com"  # Your SMTP server
       SMTP_PORT = 587
       EMAIL_USER = "your_email@gmail.com"  # Your email

   ```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python taskmeister.py
```

## Configuration

### Email Setup

#### Gmail Setup
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. Update `Config.EMAIL_USER` and `Config.EMAIL_PASS` in the code

#### Other Email Providers
Update the SMTP settings in the `Config` class:

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```python
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp-mail.outlook.com"
SMTP_PORT = 587
```

**Yahoo:**
```python
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.mail.yahoo.com"
SMTP_PORT = 587

4. **Make Assignments:** 
   - Select a worker from the list
   - Check houses to assign
   - Set quantities and add comments if needed
   - Click "Send Assignments"

### Daily Workflow
1. Select tomorrow's date (default)
2. Choose the worker for assignments
3. Select houses from the available list (already assigned houses are hidden)
4. Add quantities and comments as needed
5. Send assignments via email
6. Review history as needed

### Advanced Features

#### Search Functionality
- Use the search box above the house list to quickly find specific houses
- Search is case-insensitive and updates in real-time

## Architecture

### Clean Code Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** Each class has a clear, single purpose
- **Dependency Injection:** Services are injected rather than hardcoded
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling throughout
- **Documentation:** Full docstrings and type hints
- **Modular Design:** Separate classes for different concerns

### Key Components

#### DatabaseManager
Handles all database operations with SQLite, including:
- Table creation and migration
- CRUD operations
- Query execution with proper error handling

#### EmailService  
Manages email functionality:
- SMTP configuration
- Email composition
- Sending with error handling

#### Dialog Classes
Reusable dialog components:
- WorkerDialog for adding/editing workers
- HouseDialog for adding/editing houses
- ListSelectionDialog for generic list selection

#### Main Application (TaskMeisterApp)
The primary GUI application managing:
- UI layout and components
- Event handling
- Business logic coordination
- State management
